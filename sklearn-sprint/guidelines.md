In this sprint, we will build interactive demos from the scikit-learn documentation and, afterwards, contribute the demos directly to the docs.

## To get started ü§©

1. Head to [this page](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/) and pick an example you‚Äôd like to build on. 
2. Leave a comment on [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14EThtIyF4KfpU99Fm2EW3Rz9t6SSEqDyzV4jmw3fjyI/edit?usp=sharing) with your name under Owner column, claiming the example. The spreadsheet has a limited number of examples. Feel free to add yours with a comment if it doesn‚Äôt exist in the spreadsheet.
3. Start building!
    
    We will be hosting our applications in [scikit-learn](https://huggingface.co/scikit-learn) organization of Hugging Face. 
    
    For complete starters: in the Hugging Face Hub, there are repositories for models, datasets, and [Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces). Spaces are a special type of repository hosting ML applications, such as showcasing a model. To write our apps, we will only be using Gradio. [Gradio](https://gradio.app/) is a library that lets you build a cool front-end application for your models, completely in Python, and supports many libraries! In this sprint, we will be using mostly visualization support (`matplotlib`, `plotly`, `altair` and more) and [skops](https://skops.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) integration (which you can launch an interface for a given classification or regression interface with one line of code). 
    
    In Gradio, there‚Äôs two ways to create a demo. One is to use `Interface`, which is a very simple abstraction. Let‚Äôs see a simple example.
    
    ```python
    import gradio as gr
    
    def cancer_classifier(df):
        # implement your classifier here
    
    gr.Interface(fn=cancer_classifier, inputs="dataframe", 
    outputs="label").launch()
    
    # save this in a file called app.py
    # then run it 
    ```
    
    This will result in following interface:
    
    ![Simple Interface](./interface.png)
    
    This is very customizable. You can specify rows and columns, add a title and description, an example input, and more. There‚Äôs a more detailed guide [here](https://gradio.app/using-gradio-for-tabular-workflows/). 
    
    Another way of creating an application is to use [Blocks](https://gradio.app/quickstart/#blocks-more-flexibility-and-control). You can see usage of Blocks in the example applications linked in this guide. 
    
    After we create our application, we will create a Space. You can go to [huggingface.co](http://huggingface.co), click on your profile on top right and select ‚ÄúNew Space‚Äù.
    
    ![New Space](new_space.png)
    
    We can name our Space, pick a license and select Space SDK as ‚ÄúGradio‚Äù. Free hardware is enough for our app, so no need to change it.
    
    ![Screenshot 2023-02-01 at 14.02.04.png](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/e60550f5-0d1a-4b51-9ed6-e8cb7f0dad7a/Screenshot_2023-02-01_at_14.02.04.png)
    
    After creating the Space, you can use either the instructions below to clone the repository locally, adding your files and push, OR, graphical interface to drag and drop your application file (which we will show you).
    
    ![Space Config](./space_config.png)
    
    To upload your application file, pick ‚ÄúAdd File‚Äù and drag and drop your file.
    
    ![New Space Landing](./space_landing.png)
    
    Lastly, if your application includes any library other than Gradio, create a file called requirements.txt and add requirements like below: 
    
    ```python
    matplotlib==3.6.3
    scikit-learn==1.2.1
    ```
    
     And your app should be up and running!
    
    **Example Submissions**
    
    We left couple of examples below: (there‚Äôs more at the end of this page)
    Documentation page for comparing linkage methods for hierarchical clustering and example Space built on it üëáüèº 
    
    [Comparing different hierarchical linkage methods on toy datasets](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/cluster/plot_linkage_comparison.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-cluster-plot-linkage-comparison-py)
    
    [Hierarchical Clustering Linkage - a Hugging Face Space by scikit-learn](https://huggingface.co/spaces/scikit-learn/hierarchical-clustering-linkage)
    
    Note: If your demo is e.g. an image classifier that receives an input and outputs classes or if it doesn‚Äôt make visualizations based on a change in a model or technique but is to train a model, you can train an e.g. image classifier and push it to the Hub using [skops](https://skops.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and build a Gradio demo on top of it. For such submission, we expect a model repository with model card and the model, and, a simple Space with the interface that receives input and outputs results. You can use this tutorial to get started with [skops](insert KDNuggets tutorial when released).
    
    You can find an example submission for a model repository below.

4. After the demos are done, we will open pull requests to scikit-learn documentation in [scikit-learn‚Äôs repository](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn) to contribute our application codes to be directly inside the documentation. We will help you out if this is your first open source contribution. ü§ó¬†
